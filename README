= brice - Extra cool IRb goodness for the masses

== VERSION

This documentation refers to brice version 0.3.0


== DESCRIPTION

Enhances your IRb experience by adding new functionality and by
providing a framework that you can utilize to add your own extensions.
It comes with a set of pre-selected features (see the files in
{lib/brice/rc}[link:../lib/brice/rc]), but is highly configurable
in that regard.

Add this to your <tt>~/.irbrc</tt> and receive the default goodness:

  require 'brice/init'  # equivalent to: require 'brice'; Brice.init

Or get some more control over the configuration:

  require 'brice'

  Brice.init { |config|
    ...
  }

See Brice::Config for what you can configure, and how.

It will even load your own extensions that you place in your <tt>~/.brice</tt>
directory. See Brice::DSL for helpers provided.

Please note that further changes to the configuration for brice can't be
guaranteed to have any effect after <tt>Brice.init</tt> has been called.
